Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for
each $x \in A$
there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$. Show that $A$
is open in $X$.

\paragraph{Exercise 16.9} Show that the dictionary order topology on the set $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is the same as the product topology $\mathbb{R}_d \times \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}_d$ denotes $\mathbb{R}$ in the discrete topology.

\paragraph{Exercise 19.9} Show that the choice axiom is equivalent to the statement that for any indexed family of nonempty sets, $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ with $J \neq 0$, the cartesian product \[\prod_{\alpha \in J} A_\alpha\] is not empty.
