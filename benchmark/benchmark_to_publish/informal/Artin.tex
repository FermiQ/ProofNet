\paragraph{Exercise 2.2.9} Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by two elements $a, b$ of a group $G$. Prove that if $a b=b a$, then $H$ is an abelian group.
\begin{proof}
    Since $a$ and $b$ commute, for any $g, h\in H$ we can write $g=a^ib^j$ and $h = a^kb^l$. Then $gh = a^ib^ja^kb^l = a^kb^la^ib^j = hg$. Thus $H$ is abelian. 
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 2.3.2} Prove that the products $a b$ and $b a$ are conjugate elements in a group.
\begin{proof}
    We have that $(a^{-1})ab(a^{-1})^{-1} = ba$. 
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 2.4.19} Prove that if a group contains exactly one element of order 2 , then that element is in the center of the group.
\begin{proof}
   Let $x$ be the element of order two. Consider the element $z=y^{-1} x y$, we have: $z^2=\left(y^{-1} x y\right)^2=\left(y^{-1} x y\right)\left(y^{-1} x y\right)=e$. So: $z=x$, and $y^{-1} x y=x$. So: $x y=y x$. So: $x$ is in the center of $G$. 
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 2.8.6} Prove that the center of the product of two groups is the product of their centers.
\begin{proof}
    We have that $(g_1, g_2)\cdot (h_1, h_2) = (h_1, h_2)\cdot (g_1, g_2)$ if and only if $g_1h_1 = h_1g_1$ and $g_2h_2 = h_2g_2$. 
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 2.11.3} Prove that a group of even order contains an element of order $2 .$
\begin{proof}
    Pair up if possible each element of $G$ with its inverse, and observe that
$$
g^2 \neq e \Longleftrightarrow g \neq g^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow \text { there exists the pair }\left(g, g^{-1}\right)
$$
Now, there is one element that has no pairing: the unit $e$ (since indeed $e=e^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow e^2=e$ ), so since the number of elements of $G$ is even there must be at least one element more, say $e \neq a \in G$, without a pairing, and thus $a=a^{-1} \Longleftrightarrow a^2=e$
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 3.2.7} Prove that every homomorphism of fields is injective.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $f(a)=f(b)$, then $f(a-b)=0=f(0)$. If $u=(a-b) \neq 0$, then $f(u) f\left(u^{-1}\right)=f(1)=1$, but that means that $0 f\left(u^{-1}\right)=1$, which is impossible. Hence $a-b=0$ and $a=b$.
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 3.5.6} Let $V$ be a vector space which is spanned by a countably infinite set. Prove that every linearly independent subset of $V$ is finite or countably infinite.


\paragraph{Exercise 3.7.2} Let $V$ be a vector space over an infinite field $F$. Prove that $V$ is not the union of finitely many proper subspaces.


\paragraph{Exercise 6.1.14} Let $Z$ be the center of a group $G$. Prove that if $G / Z$ is a cyclic group, then $G$ is abelian and hence $G=Z$.


\paragraph{Exercise 6.4.2} Prove that no group of order $p q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime, is simple.
\begin{proof}
    If $|G|=n=p q$ then the only two Sylow subgroups are of order $p$ and $q$.
From Sylow's third theorem we know that $n_p \mid q$ which means that $n_p=1$ or $n_p=q$.
If $n_p=1$ then we are done (by a corollary of Sylow's theorem)
If $n_p=q$ then we have accounted for $q(p-1)=p q-q$ elements of $G$ and so there is only one group of order $q$ and again we are done.
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 6.4.3} Prove that no group of order $p^2 q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime, is simple.
\begin{proof}
    We may as well assume $p<q$. The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups is $1 \bmod q$ and divides $p^2$. So it is $1, p$, or $p^2$. We win if it's 1 and it can't be $p$, so suppose it's $p^2$. But now $q \mid p^2-1$, so $q \mid p+1$ or $q \mid p-1$.
Thus $p=2$ and $q=3$. But we know no group of order 36 is simple. 
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 6.4.12} Prove that no group of order 224 is simple.
\begin{proof}
    The following proves there must exist a normal Sylow 2 -subgroup of order 32 ,
Suppose there are $n_2=7$ Sylow 2 -subgroups in $G$. Making $G$ act on the set of these Sylow subgroups by conjugation (Mitt wrote about this but on the set of the other Sylow subgroups, which gives no contradiction), we get a homomorphism $G \rightarrow S_7$ which must be injective if $G$ is simple (why?).

But this cannot be since then we would embed $G$ into $S_7$, which is impossible since $|G| \nmid 7 !=\left|S_7\right|$ (why?)
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 6.8.1} Prove that two elements $a, b$ of a group generate the same subgroup as $b a b^2, b a b^3$.


\paragraph{Exercise 6.8.4} Prove that the group generated by $x, y, z$ with the single relation $y x y z^{-2}=1$ is actually a free group.


\paragraph{Exercise 6.8.6} Let $G$ be a group with a normal subgroup $N$. Assume that $G$ and $G / N$ are both cyclic groups. Prove that $G$ can be generated by two elements.


\paragraph{Exercise 10.1.13} An element $x$ of a ring $R$ is called nilpotent if some power of $x$ is zero. Prove that if $x$ is nilpotent, then $1+x$ is a unit in $R$.
\begin{proof}
    If $x^n=0$, then
$$
(1+x)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^k x^k\right)=1+(-1)^{n-1} x^n=1 .
$$
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Exercise 10.2.4} Prove that in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x],(2) \cap(x)=(2 x)$.

\paragraph{Exercise 10.4.6} Let $I, J$ be ideals in a ring $R$. Prove that the residue of any element of $I \cap J$ in $R / I J$ is nilpotent.


\paragraph{Exercise 10.4.7a} Let $I, J$ be ideals of a ring $R$ such that $I+J=R$. Prove that $I J=I \cap J$.


\paragraph{Exercise 10.5.16} Let $F$ be a field. Prove that the rings $F[x] /\left(x^2\right)$ and $F[x] /\left(x^2-1\right)$ are isomorphic if and only if $F$ has characteristic $2 .$


\paragraph{Exercise 10.7.6} Prove that the ring $\mathbb{F}_5[x] /\left(x^2+x+1\right)$ is a field.


\paragraph{Exercise 10.7.10} Let $R$ be a ring, with $M$ an ideal of $R$. Suppose that every element of $R$ which is not in $M$ is a unit of $R$. Prove that $M$ is a maximal ideal and that moreover it is the only maximal ideal of $R$.


\paragraph{Exercise 11.2.13} If $a, b$ are integers and if $a$ divides $b$ in the ring of Gauss integers, then $a$ divides $b$ in $\mathbb{Z}$.


\paragraph{Exercise 11.3.1} Let $a, b$ be elements of a field $F$, with $a \neq 0$. Prove that a polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is irreducible if and only if $f(a x+b)$ is irreducible.
