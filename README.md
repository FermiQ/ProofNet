# ProofNet
A benchmark for undergraduate-level formal mathematics. We pose problems that require knowledge of introductory
- linear algbera, 
- abstract algebra, 
- real analysis, 
- complex analysis, 
- topology 
to solve. 
## Naming Conventions
- Problems coming from should be named `{authors}_{chapter}_{problem_number}` or `{authors}_{chapter}_{section}_{problem_number}`, e.g `rudin_3_8` or `dummitfoote_3_2_1`. 
- Problems coming from competitions should be named `{competition}_{year}_{problem_number}`, e.g `imo_1990_6` or `putnam_2021_b4`. 
- Original problems should be given a short descriptive name, roughly in line with mathlib conventions.
