\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.1a} If $x$ is irrational and $y$ is rational, then $x+y$ is irrational.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.2} Prove that there is no rational number $x$ such that $x^2=12$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.5} Let $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers bounded below. Prove that $\inf A = -\sup(-A)$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.11a} Prove that every complex number $z$ can be written in the form $z=r\omega$ where $r\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\omega$ is a complex number of modulus $1$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.13} Prove that $|\|x\|-\|y\||\leq \|x-y\|$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.16a} Let $x$ and $y$ be distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$. Let $d$ be the distance between $x$ and $y$. If $r$ is any positive number such that $2r>d$, prove that the set of points $z$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $|z-x|=r$ and $|z-y|=r$ is infinite.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.18a} If $x$ is a nonzero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, prove that there exists a nonzero vector $y$ such that $x\cdot y = 0$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.1.19} Let $a, b, c$ be three points in the plane, and let $x$ be a fourth point. Prove that $x$ is equidistant from $a$ and $b$ if and only if $x$ is at a distance $r$ from $c$, where $r$ is the distance from $b$ to $c$.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.2.24} Prove that every metric space $X$ in which every infinite subset has a limit point is separable.

\paragraph{Rudin.exercise.2.27a} Let $E$ be a non-countable subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$. Let $P$ be the set of all points $x$ such that every neighborhood of $x$ contains a non-countable subset of $E$. Prove that $P$ is closed and that $P$ is the set of all cluster points of $E$.
