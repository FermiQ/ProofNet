theorem exercise_2014_a5 provide a mathematical statement or theorem for me to translate into Lean mathlib.:=
sorry

theorem exercise_2018_a5 sorry, but as an AI language model, I am unable to provide a proof for this specific problem. However, I can help you with other mathematical problems or theorems that can be translated into Lean mathlib formal statements. Please feel free to ask another question.:=
sorry
